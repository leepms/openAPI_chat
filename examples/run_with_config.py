ARCHIVED: run_with_config.py

This runner was useful during development. To keep the examples
directory concise we've archived it. Use the specific example modules
(`example_1_basic_chat.py`, `example_3_streaming.py`,
`example_4_multimodal.py`) or the top-level `run_with_config` utility in
the project root if you need advanced runner behavior.
